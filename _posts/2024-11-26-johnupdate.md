## Models and Bottles (of milk)

Hi everyone, welcome to a slightly lacking week in JohnFantasy-land.

This week I didn't make much progress, but I did work on the model for predicting QB performance this morning. So far so good, but the real challenge will be porting the successful model to the discord bot script. Still not sure how I will be going about that. I want to ensure that
there is an easy-enough way for the model to be retrained each week, as it relies on historical data. The more up-to-date data I am able to include, the more accurate the model will be. Since the data updates on a weekly basis, some sort of weekly script triggering would be ideal. This limits
the options I have for deployment, as just porting the coefficients will be time consuming in a way I don't want to deal with.

Norwegian is also going well, but these last few lessons have been rough. Deciphering between things like skjort (shirt) and kjole (dress) and sko (shoes) is hard. Jeg snakker norsk av og til, og vennene min snakker aldri.
