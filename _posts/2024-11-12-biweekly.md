## BI-weekly Updates (who would have thought)

Hello everyone, and welcome to my blog on this glorious November morning.

I've done it.

JohnFantasy is alive, albeit barebones. He exists in a server, is able to receive commands, and can send messages. All of the basic functionality is there.
I will be creating and sharing a design doc soon. I hope to, by the end of this week, get at least one of the core new commands working, likely the scoreboard feature, which should spit out the current weeks scoreboard. Will make it easier to do weekly result roundups.  

I also recently started learning Norwegian. Its very hard, but it provides my brain little challenges throughout the day.  

I think I can say with fair certainty that I will speak to y'all next week! Make it a good one.
