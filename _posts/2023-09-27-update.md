## Update - September 27th 2023

Long time no speak!  
Since my last post, I have graduated from Appalachian State, got a job as a Data Engineer, uprooted my family and moved to Dallas, Texas, and had a baby! To call this the craziest year of my life would probably be an understatement.  

An update on the chatbot: AustinI was successfully deployed shortly after my last update post on him. Unfortunately, the hosting service I used required me to upgrade to a paid teir in order to house the amount of data that was required
for his use. I did not think that would be the best use of my funds following my final presentation, so the project has been shut down. My presentation went great, and I believe I received somewhere in the 80's as a final grade.
Taking care of the bot and delivering him was a valuable experience in not only regular development, but AI systems, hosting systems, and general Python coding.  

An update on school: I am not finished. I am currently awaiting a decision on my application for admission to the Spring 2024 cohort of the University of Texas at Austin Masters of Data Science Online. It is a prestigious university,
highly selective, but hopefully obtainable for yours truly.  

An update on general topics: I am hopefully reviving this blog. I have a renewed fervor for furthering my career and my understanding of Data Science topics. I will be beginning a new, multi-week project soon and will be posting my updates here,
as always.  

Talk soon,  
Austin
