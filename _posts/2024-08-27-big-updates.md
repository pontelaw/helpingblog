## It's Been A Long While

Hello everyone, hope you've been good. It's that time of year again, when I bring live updates to your digital doorstep. And by live updates, I mean an entire years worth of updates.

So for starters, I am halfway through my Master's program. I've both learned alot and at times learned not so much, but there are several Data Science related things that I have a much better grasp on then I once did. Namely in the Data Engineering realm, and the Data Mining and Machine Learning realm.  

I am still at Forescout for the time being, and I am really enjoying the job. I recently transitioned from working on the TDR product to the REM product, which has represented a large change in workflow. I really
feel like I am on the cutting edge of something at this company, and the thought of taking ownership over such a large project is both daunting and exciting.

I also recently got certified in Microsoft Azure. Cloud computing platforms are just becoming so ubiquitious that it made a lot of sense to get ahead of the game for once and learn one of the platforms. I recently got full access to Azure, and messing around with the services A) Made me feel really smart and like a go-getter and B) Made me really excited to get in further with these tools in a business setting.

My goals stay the same. I want to someday lead a data team. I want to make decisions, and be paid handsomly when they work out. Here's to hoping.

Family is good. John is running around, and gets more and more personality every day. He even *fingers crossed* sleeps through the night every once and a while. He is the light in my life and every day with him is a blessing.

Anyways, I'm still playing Rocket League, I'm still Diamond in Twos, and that's about it there. Until next time.

Austin
