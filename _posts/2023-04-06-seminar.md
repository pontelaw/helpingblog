## Seminar Post 7 - Final Topic Presenatations
We have now listened to everyone describe the topics for their final presentations and I am going to talk about the 2 that I am most interested to hear more about.  
  
A recurring theme during these talks was the use of Artificial Intelligence in many fields. One of those fields, whether or not the use of AI generated art violates copyright law,
I believe is going to have a large impact on the future of AI. Many things are going to need to be decided soon relating to how much of a human's rights get attributed to 
things made to act human. Are all things derivative if made by a robot? Or are they capable of creativity in the eyes of the law?  
  
Another aspect of AI we will cover that I find interesting is the development of human-AI relationships. People can develop deep emotional attachments to things that cannot
develop attachments back so it will be interesting to explore the results and impacts of this phenomenon.  
  
Those are the two topics I find most interesting, besides my own, which will be exploring the prospects of AI replacement in the work force. I look forward to hearing about 
everyone's research.
