## AustinI: A Chatbot with Personality - Update 3/26

Hello everyone,  
  
Not much to report on the chatbot front. I am currently working on the technical documentation, and my upcoming presentation. This week I will at the very least have
a working demo. If time constraints allow, I may have a command line interface present for deploying the chatbot. My research has proven that specifically deploying the
bot to a website may turn out more difficult than the project timeline may allow. Stay tuned.
