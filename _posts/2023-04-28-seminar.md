## Seminar Post 7 - Final Thoughts

The three most important things I learned this semester:  
  
1. I learned a bit more about the importance of staying ethical within digital fields and what can happen when you don't maintain your security systems.  
  
2. I became a bit more familiar with the biggest problems facing AI in dealing with normal society.  
  
3. And lastly, I was able to delve a bit further into the process of securing a job after graduation. I believe our discussions on this helped me.  
  
The main piece of advice I would give is to take the blog semi-seriously. Recruiters appreciate when you have a proper portfolio, and if you don't have one this can be it.
It also doesn't hurt, even if they don't look at it, to have a github link to be able to attach to your resume that doesn't just link to your basic repo list. I used this
to talk about my capstone project, and to detail my upcoming and past projects. Just think about it.
