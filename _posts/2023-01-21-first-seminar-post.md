## Seminar Post 1 - Intro

Welcome to my blog!
My best computing experience would be in 1440 and 2440 when we would finish an assignment and see all the green checkmarks indicating our solution was correct. The same is true for the Web-Cat 100% bar.
My best out of class computing experience would be working on building data pipelines for my internship with Appalachian Voices. Creating something that was going to be useful for a lot of people made the programming a little less tiresome.
Thanks!
