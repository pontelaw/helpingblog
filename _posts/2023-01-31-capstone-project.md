## AustinI: A Chatbot with personality

For my main project this semester, I am building an AI chatbot that will take input and respond in a more natural way. Designed to combat the staleness of other AI, 
this intelligence can hold normal conversations. I trained it on a .json of questions and answers built around my normal speech. This includes things like more vibrant and
less stiff word choice.\n I will be updating based off progress each week. This week, I am working on implementing the skeleton of the python script, and bugfixing so that I can
train the model next week.\n
Built using tensorflow and keras natural language processing.
