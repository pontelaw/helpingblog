## Upcoming Project Ideas
Double post, I know, who am I. Figured I would also share a post detailing some ideas I have had over the past 2 years of personal projects I would like to take on.  
  
<h3>BaseballSavant Style Website for NFL FastR</h3>  
BaseballSavant is a website that allows you, basically, to query the MLB player database. You can search just about any parameter and get the requested info. I have
access to a similar NFL dataset, called NFL FastR for the R language, and I would like to create a web interface for queries.  
  
<h3>Outside Status with RaspberryPi</h3>
Essentially use a RaspberryPi and a small screen to display weather info and other status of the outside world numbers.  

<h3>Adblocking with PiHole</h3>
PiHole is a great tool you can build with a RaspberryPi that connects to your router and acts as a whole network ad-blocker. Especially useful on devices where you cannot
easily install an ad-block tool (like the tv).

<h3>College Football Computer Rankings</h3>
Very simple. Tons of people have a formula that they input the latest college football scores into and it spits out a top 25. I feel like I coould do a decent job predicting
the playoffs if I were to create a program for this.

<h3>NFL Fantasy Football Evaluators</h3>
I am a big fan of fantasy football, and I'd like to create a tool to analyze top performers and pickups to optimize my team and increase my chances of winning.  
  
This is subject to change, and I'll check em off as I get them done!
