# How Far To Go

This is the first update of the year. This year, which I will name the year of machine learning and career development, will likely mark great changes in my life.

My goal for the year is simple: transition into machine learning full time. I have a path set out for me, and all I need to do is prepare myself to follow it.

The semester starts in a few weeks. I am taking Visualization and Unstructured Data Analysis and Deep Learning. I do not expect these to be very fun, but hopefully only having two classes makes the workload more manageable. Last semester was a slog.

At the moment, I do not have a project in development. I am aiming to focus full time on reaquainting myself with machine learning in python. I believe this will mostly consist of relearning libraries I have forgotten. I will be focusing on neural networks and decesion trees / forests.

Norwegian is on a 60~ day streak. Something I learned recently is that the language has its own form of the english adverb ending -ly. In english, the word friendly meaning someone who is kind and friend-like, is simply friend + -ly. In Norwegian, it is the word for friend, "venn", and the ending -lig or vennlig. Very cool. I've heard that DuoLingo does a bad job at explaining grammar concepts and I would agree, but luckily I am learning them intuitively. If only I could figure out why "this" is sometimme dette and sometimes denne.

Alright talk next week, good bye and god helg.
