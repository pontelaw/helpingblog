## Weekly Update Part 2

I did it everyone, I am making a post for the second week in a row.  
  
This week some stuff went down, some very disappointing stuff but nothing I can do about it. 
  
My new project idea has nothing to do with chess. I will be using the ESPN API to create a Discord bot that will be able output matchup info, results, and I wouuld like to incorporate a linear regression model that can predict a player's points for a given week.  

I will name this project John Fantasy. Wow, what a great name.  
  
Wish me luck!
