## JohnFantasy Is Going Strong

Hey everyone, 4 weeks in a row Austin here.  

JohnFantasy continues to live! This week, I dived further into the espn-api library, taking advantage of the full set of functions it provides, and heavily refreshing my OOP knowledge. I had forgotten how simple OOP makes everything.  

A little more in-depth, I completed the matchups, recent activity and standings commands. The matchups command relays a weeks matchups (and results), the recent activity command outputs the last n events in the activity log (player drops, adds, trades, etc.), and the 
standings command outputs the current standings, with their divisions, W/L, and points for stats.  

I also sort-of started work on the machine learning models. I rediscovered nflreadR, a R package that makes it really easy to pull game-by-game player data from the official NFL databases. Using this dataset, I will be able to create a linear regression model for all offensive positions.
I haven't decided how I am going to carry these R models into the discord bot python script, or how the python script will be able to make use of the model, but that will be decided semi-soon.

Hooray for making things!
