## AustinI: Chatbot With Personality - Update 2/13/2023

I am here with an update!  
  
After many hours over the past weekend, we have a working (?) model! It barely works at all, but the script at least runs without errors!  
  
This has been an experiment to say the least, and I am seeing a lot of progress in my understanding of concepts like loss functions and model layering. Tuesday is my first presentation for the project. I'll let you know how it goes.
