## 2 Updates from Me

I'm back for another update.  

I am pleased to "announce" that I have received an offer of admission from the University of Wisconsin for entrance into their online Masters in Data Science degree. I will be starting in January, and I am very excited to further my data science studies in the online classroom.  

The second annoncement is that chess is on hiatus. I have lost a bit of ambition for the project and will more than likely revisit in the future.  

Talk again soon.
