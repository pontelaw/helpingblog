  <b>Hello!</b>
  <br><br>
  My name is Austin Phillips and I am a Computer and Data Science student at Appalachian State University.  
  <br><br>  
  
  I originally come from Wisconsin, but have made NC, SC, TX and KY home in the past.  
    
  My main passions in Computer and Data Science are relational databases, and data cleaning, analyzing, and management. I love taking a good dataset and making it speak.  
    
  I currently am looking for jobs as a Junior or Level 1 Data Scientist in the Raleigh or Dallas areas. I am also open for remote or hybrid work. My projected graduation is May 2023.
