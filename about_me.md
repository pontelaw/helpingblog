  _______________________________________________________________________________________________<br>
  <b>Hello!</b>
  <br><br>
  My name is Austin Phillips and I am a Data Engineer at Forescout Technologies.  
  <br>
  
  I originally come from Wisconsin, but have made NC, SC, TX and KY home in the past.  
    
  My main passions in Computer and Data Science are relational databases, and data cleaning, analyzing, and management. I love taking a good dataset and making it speak.  
    
  I currently am looking to pursue a Masters Degree in Data Science.
