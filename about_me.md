  <b>Hello!</b>
  <br><br>
  My name is Austin Phillips and I am a Data Engineer at Forescout Technologies.

  I live in Texas, where I have been since graduating with a Bachelor's in Computer Science.  
    
  My main passions in Computer and Data Science are machine learning, project efficiency, and cloud operations. I someday hope to lead a team of likeminded people.
